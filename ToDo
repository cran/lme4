-----
Modify mcmcsamp to return the deviance in the sample only when the
optional argument 'deviance' is TRUE (default FALSE).
-----
Replace the use of the unexported replacement function LMEoptimize<-
in lmer.R by the function LMEopt, which always returns NULL but
(in contradiction to the language specification) modifies its first argument.
-----
Modify the one-argument form of the anova method for lmer objects (yet
  again) to calculate the F ratios.  It is the df, not the ratio that
  is controversial.
Should there be an extractor function for the mean square error?  If
  so, what should it be called?
-----
Determine what a "coef" function should do for multiple, possibly
  non-nested, grouping  factors.
-----
- add nicer (more realistic?) pedigree examples and tests

- document print(<mer>) including an example  print(<lmer>, corr = FALSE)
